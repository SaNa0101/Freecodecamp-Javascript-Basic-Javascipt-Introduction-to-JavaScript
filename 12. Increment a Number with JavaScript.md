# Increment a Number with JavaScript


You can easily increment or add one to a variable with the `++` operator.

`i++;`

is the equivalent of

`i = i + 1;`

## Note
The entire line becomes `i++`;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

## Instructions
 - Change the code to use the ++ operator on myVar.
