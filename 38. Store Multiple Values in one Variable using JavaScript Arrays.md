# Store Multiple Values in one Variable using JavaScript Arrays

With JavaScript `array` variables, we can store several pieces of data
in one place.

You start an array declaration with an opening square bracket,
end it with a closing square bracket, and put a comma between each
entry, like this:

`var sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"].`

## Instructions
 - Modify the new array `myArray` so that it contains both a `string` and a
 `number` (in that order).

### Setup

```javascript
// Example
var array = ["John", 23];

// Only change code below this line.
var myArray = [];
```

### Answers

`var myArray = ["Sana", 23];`
